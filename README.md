# etch-a-sketch

A webpage using a tile-based grid system ranging from values 1x1 to 60x60 grid sizes. Each grid can be colored either by a green colored pixel or a "rainbow" color that utilizes a random rgb function to return the color that pixel gets colored. These options are controlled by buttons that also include a "reset" button which resets every tile in the grid back to its original white color. Made for The Odin Project.
